TO DO
-- Overlay GUI
    -- Subtle/transparent
    -- Start and stop
        -- OCR to sync for min plane ride time
-- Detect similarities
    -- For names
    -- For kill feed events (to handle scrolling/fading)
-- Generate graph
-- Generate csv
-- Website
    -- could just generate the graph on the website...
    -- Or do both! the web one will look nicer

    -- global data
    -- your data
    -- game data (list all uploaded games)




We're gonna need a good set of test images
Maybe stop grabbing the whole log and only grab one or two lines? This may cost us in accuracy
Multithread the OCR
